There are two common case where you might need to loop using index values:\n\n1. If you want to update individual values in a list you're likely going to need a loop that includes the index values. To update a list value, you need to refer to both the list and index, which means looping using the list values directly won't work. There are functions such as `enumerate()` that can help, but their use can be somewhat confusing for new programmers.\n2.
