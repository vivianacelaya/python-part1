The idea is simple: **If** a condition is met, **then** a set of actions are performed. \n\n### A simple conditional statement\n\nLet’s look at a simple example with temperatures, and check if the temperature 17 (celsius degrees) is hot (greater than 25) or not.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"temperature = 17\n\n# If the temperature is greater than 25, print the temperature is hot\n# Otherwise, print the temperature is not hot\n\nif temperature > 25: \n    print (\"Hot\")\nelse: \n    print (\"Not Hot\")\n    ","metadata":{"trusted":true,"tags":[]},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Not Hot\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What did we do here?\nFirst, we used the `if` and `else` statements to determine what parts of the code to execute.\n\nWhat do these tests do?\nThe `if` statement checks to see whether the variable value for `temperature` is greater than 25.\nIf this condition were true, `'17 is hot'` would be written to the screen. \nSince 17 is smaller than 25, the `if` condition is false and thus the code beneath `else` is executed.\nNotice that the code indented under the `if` statement is not executed if the condition is not true.\nInstead, code under the `else` statement gets executed. \nThe code under the `else` statement will run whenever the `if` condition is false.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Check your understanding \n\nUpdate the value of `temperature` to a \"hot\" temperature:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"temperature = 33\n\nif temperature > 25: \n    print (\"Hot\")\nelse: \n    print (\"Not Hot\")","metadata":{"tags":["hide-cell"],"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Hot\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### if without else?\n\nThe combination of `if` and `else` is very common, but the `else` statement is not strictly required.
