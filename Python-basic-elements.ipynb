Although this approach works, it can become quite laborous and error-prone when working with more complicated sets of textual and/or numerical components. In addition, it is sometimes desirable to format the numerical output to change the number of decimal places for floating point values, for example. Hence, next we show a few useful techniques that make manipulating strings easier and more efficient.\n\nThere are three approaches that can be used to manipulate strings in Python:\n\n1. f-strings\n2. the `.format()` method\n3. using the `%` operator\n\nThe f-string approach is recommended and the most modern, introduced in Python 3.6. However, since you are likely to find examples of the older approaches we also show how they work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### f-String formatting\n\nHere, we show how we can combine the `station_name` text, `station_id` integer number and another floating point number `temp` using Python's f-string formatting approach.

Let's break the f-string down a bit to understand how it works.\n\n![F-string formatting explained](img/F-string-formatting.png)\n*f-string formatting explained.

This is because the f-string functionality does the data type conversion for us.\n- It is possible to round numbers on the fly to a specific precision, such as two decimal points as in our example by adding format specifier (`:.2f`) after the variable that we want to format.\n    - The format specifier works by first adding a colon (`:`) after the variable name\n    - The decimal precision can be specified by adding a dot (`.`) followed by a number that indicates the number of decimal places (two in our case)\n    - The final character `f` in the format specifier defines the type of the conversion that will be conducted\n        - `f` will convert the value to decimal number\n        - `e` will make the number appear in scientific notation\n        - `%` will convert the value to a percentage\n\nOf the above, the most important thing is to remember to include the `f` at the start of your f-strings :). ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Other approaches for string formatting (not recommended)\n\nAs mentioned above, there are other approaches that can be used to format text and combine different data types. The first one is the `.format()` method. For example:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 2. .format() approach (no longer recommended)\ninfo_text2 = \"The temperature at {0} station (ID: {1}) is {2:.2f} Celsius.\".format(\n    station_name, station_id, temp\n)\nprint(info_text2)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"tags":[]},"execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The temperature at Helsinki Kaivopuisto station (ID: 132310) is 18.57 Celsius.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, here we get the same result as with f-strings using the `.format()` method, which is placed after the quotes. Placeholders are inserted inside curly braces where the numbers refer to the order of the variables listed in the `.format()` function. There are other ways to use this same approach, but the example above is typical.\n\nThe last (historical) string formatting approach is to use the `%` operator. In this approach, the placeholder `%` is added within the quotes, and the variables that are inserted into the body of text are placed inside parentheses after another `%` operator, like this:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 3. % operator approach (no longer recommended)\ninfo_text3 = \"The temperature at %s station (ID: %s) is %.2f Celsius.\" % (\n    station_name,\n    station_id,\n    temp,\n)\nprint(info_text3)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"tags":[]},"execution_count":53,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The temperature at Helsinki Kaivopuisto station (ID: 132310) is 18.57 Celsius.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The order of the variables within the parentheses specify which `%` placeholder will receive what information and the number of variables should be exactly the same as the number of `%` placeholders within the text template.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### More information about formatting text and numbers\n\nOf course, there is much more that can be done to format and interact with character strings and numbers.
